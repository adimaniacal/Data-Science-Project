# Air-Travel-Insights: Analytics for U.S. Airlines On-Time Performance

The project focusses on investigating delays at flight level.

The goal is to reproduce factors associated with flights delays. And this is developed by analyzing the trend with respect to arrival and departure delays. The models are then integrated in the form of a system for aircraft delay analysis and airport delay assessment.

The available dataset is provided by Research and Innovative Technology Administration (RITA) and Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS). We analyze the 2008 Expo data set to discover some patterns about the delayed flights according to time, locations, and different carriers, amongst other factors. We try to show a reasonable way to pick a flight based on different criteria. 

Visualizing the airline on-time performance can give a traveler accurate information in making a smart decision on booking a flight. This in return also motivates airlines and airports to find efficient ways to improve their performance. The purpose of our questions is aimed to find a better way for identifying best flights and avoiding the worst airports.
